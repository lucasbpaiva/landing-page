# Landing Page

The goal of this project was to create a static landing page from a given layout. The reference layout was the following:

![Reference Layout](./images/page-layout.png)

With this project I was able to practice css styling and recreating layouts. The main tool I used for positioning the objects on the page was flexbox and the main challenges I faced were dealing with image sizes where specifying a fixed width solved the issue of the image overflowing the page and also some issues with margins where I had to remove margins that were automatically created by explicitly setting the margin of a given element to 0px.
